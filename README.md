# iOS-Game
This is a game for iPhone that I wrote when I was in middle school and updated when I was in high school.

## Gameplay
Press the sides of the screen to shoot down the blocks before they reach the sides of the screen. Missing a block or letting it reach the side of the screen results in a loss of a life.

## Difficulty
There are two settings for difficulty: easy and regular. Both levels have 5 lives, but blocks spawn more quickly in regular mode.
